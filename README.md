ðŸŽ® Fun Facts

I love to watch anime of all sorts, I have been watching anime since I was a kid, I enjoy playing video games, pretty much anything that I can get on with the buddies after work. 
My favorite programming challenge is any challenge that can make my head hurt and not feel satifisfied until it is solved.
